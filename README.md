# Unit Operations Lab - Continous Distillation

This contains the data and report of a continous distillation experiment. The
experiment was carried out as part of the Unit Operations Laboratory course at
IIT Kanpur for which I was a teaching assistant. The course requirement was to
obtain the values via experiment and from the McCabe-Thiele theoretical method.

## Details
The raw data is present in the excel file.

## Implementation
- The graphs were made with Excel and [xmgrace](plasma-gate.weizmann.ac.il/Grace/doc/Tutorial.html)
- The steps for the reboiler and partial reboiler were made with [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/tutorials/)
- The report was prepared with the [docuYoda starter](https://github.com/HaoZeke/docuYoda_Starter)
