# Continuous Distillation : Experiment 4

## Objective

The objective is to study the process of continuous distillation in a sieve plate column, for the separation of a water-ethanol mixture. The tray efficiency for the column, mass and energy balances, and heat loss should also be determined. 

## Apparatus Required

*Equipment required:* Distillation column made of glass with perforated plates, specific gravity bottle, specific gravity balance, Abbe refractometer, laboratory droppers, laboratory glassware. 

The mixture to be separated is ethanol-water. The actual number of plates in the distillation column is $12$. Metering pumps have been used for the feed and the reflux.

## Theory

Doctor Strange planned the ENDGAME all along.

### Assumptions

In order to plot the locus of all passing streams in the rectifying section as a straight line of the form $y = mx + c$, the total molar flow rates $L$ and $V$ cannot vary from stage to stage. The following are the *McCabe-Thiele assumptions* @(seader2016separation), @(gorak2014distillation). 

1. The mixture is binary.
2. The column operates in the steady-state condition.
3.  The feed stream is mixed with the feed stage fluids prior to separation.
4. Each stage reaches equilibrium.
5. The two components have equal and constant molar enthalpies of vaporization (latent heats).
6. Component sensible-enthalpy changes ($C_p \Delta T$) and heat of mixing are negligible compared to latent heat changes.
7. The column is well insulated so that heat loss is negligible.
8. The pressure is uniform throughout the column (no pressure drop).

The assumptions above lead to the condition of *constant molar overflow* in the rectifying section. Constant molar overflow refers to a molar liquid flow rate that remains constant as the liquid flows over each weir, from one stage to the next.

### External Reflux Ratio

The liquid entering the top stage is the external reflux rate, $L_0$, and its ratio to the distillate rate, $L_0/D$, is the reflux
ratio, $R$. Because of the assumption of constant molar overflow, $R$ is a constant in the rectifying section @(seader2016separation), @(smith2012distillation):

$$ R = \frac{L}{D} $$

### Rectifying Section

A material balance for the light key over the envelope shown in the figure for the total condenser and stages $1$ to $n$ is as follows, where $y$ and $x$ refer to vapor and liquid mole fractions, respectively, for the light key:

$$ V_{n+l} y_{n+l} = L_n x_n + D x_D $$

### Feed Conditions

blah blah

| **Feed condition**     | **f**       | **q**      | **q Calculation**                                            |
| ---------------------- | ----------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Subcooled liquid       | $f < 0$     | $q > 1$    | $q = [c_{P,L} (T_{bp} - T_F ) + \Delta H_{vap} ]/ \Delta H_{vap}$ |
| Liquid at bubble point | $0$         | $1$        | $q = \Delta H_{vap} / \Delta H_{vap} = 1$                    |
| Partially vaporized    | $0 < f < 1$ | $1< q < 0$ | $q = [(1 - f) \Delta H_{vap} ] / \Delta H_{vap} $            |
| Vapor at dew point     | $1$         | $0$        | $q = 0$                                                      |
| Superheated vapor      | $f > 1$     | $q < 0$    | $q = - [c_{P,V} (T_F - T_{dp} )] / \Delta H_{vap} $          |

## Procedure 

1. The flow rate through the condenser was set at $2.5 L/min$.
2. The calibration curve for refractive index with alcohol percent was obtained. The calibration curve for specific gravity was also calculated.
3. The feed composition was determined and the reboiler was filled with it.
4. Start heating the reboiler and circulate cooling water in the condenser.
5. Determine minimum reflux ratio for the feed conditions assuming 85 mol purity of the distillate.
6. Operate under a reflux ratio higher than minimum reflux, ratio, and obtain samples at the steady states.
7. Measure all flow rates (distillate, reflux, feed, cooling water) and temperature (bottom, distillate, condenser inlet and outlet). Measure power (kwh) point input to boiler.
8. Measure refractive indices of samples of feed, distillate and still liquid.
9. Measure the specific gravity of the distillate collected.

## Results and Discussion 

1. Ethanol and water form a minimum boiling azeotrope at a composition of $95.5 \%$ by weight of ethanol @(speight2005lange), @(lide2003crc). Once this composition has been achieved, the liquid and vapour have the same composition, and no further separation is possible without using an entrainer. 
   Absolute alcohol can be obtained using the process of heterogenous azeotropic distillation @(seader2016separation).  The addition of benzene to an ethanol-water mixture results in the formation of a minimum-boiling, heterogeneous ternary, azeotrope containing, by weight, $18.5 \%$ alcohol, $74.1 \%$ benzene, and $7.4 \%$ water, boiling at $64.85 ^\circ$C. Upon condensation, the ternary azeotrope separates into two liquid layers: a top layer containing $14.5 \%$ alcohol, $84.5 \%$ benzene, and $1 \%$ water, and a bottoms layer of $53 \%$ alcohol, $11 \%$ benzene, and $36 \%$ water, by weight. The benzene-rich layer is returned as reflux. The other layer is sent to a second distillation column for recovery and recycling of alcohol and benzene. Absolute alcohol, which has a boiling point above that of the ternary azeotrope, is removed at the bottom of the column.

We now conclude that Ash was dreaming all along.
